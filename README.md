Calculator Application

This is a simple GUI-based calculator application built using Python's tkinter library. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features

User-friendly Interface: Intuitive layout with buttons for numbers, operators, clear, and equals.

Dynamic Button Creation: Buttons are created dynamically from a predefined configuration.

Basic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Error Handling: Displays an "Error" message for invalid inputs or operations.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd calculator-app

Run the application:

python calculator.py

How to Use

Launch the application by running the calculator.py script.

Use the number and operator buttons to input your calculations.

Click = to see the result.

Use the C button to clear the input field.

Code Overview

The application is implemented in a single Python file, calculator.py. Below are some key components:

Entry Widget:

Displays user input and calculation results.

Positioned at the top of the interface.

Buttons:

Created dynamically from a list of configurations.

Each button is assigned a specific function based on its label.

Event Handling:

on_button_click(symbol): Handles button clicks and performs the appropriate action (append input, clear field, or evaluate expression).

Known Issues

Uses Python's eval() for expression evaluation, which can be a security risk if the input is not trusted.

Future Improvements

Replace eval() with a safer expression evaluator.

Add support for keyboard input.

Enhance UI with distinct button colors for numbers, operators, and special actions.

Include a history of previous calculations.
